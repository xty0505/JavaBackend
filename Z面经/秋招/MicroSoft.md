Xia Tianyu and I are in the same laboratory project team when I was in Fudan. During his undergraduate years, he mastered a lot of basic knowledge of computer science and thus has a good foundation. Later, he passed the postgraduate entrance examination of Fudan University with his own efforts, and continued to study here. In Fudan, he showed a great interest in the field of big data and data analysis. He first learned theoretical knowledge and then participated in the development of Data Hubble project. Gradually, he became the main member of this project, helping it acheve a good result in the mid-term report. What's more, he also carried out research on Interactive data exploration. This summer, he also participated in enterprise application development at ByteDance as an intern, accumulating a lot of work experience.

In addition to technical skills, he is a self-driven person, which means he can always urge himself to learn new knowledge. He is willing to face challenges and is not afraid to step out of comfort zone. He once mentioned that he admires Microsoft’s corporate philosophy and technical strength, and dreams of being able to work at Microsoft. I think he is a nice person to work with so I recommend him to join us.
